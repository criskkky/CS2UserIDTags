# CS2UserIDTags Plugin

## Description
Each player joining the server receives a clan tag representing their UserID, allowing for administrative actions such as mutes, bans, gags, and more to be associated directly with their unique identifier. This simplifies interactions as administrators can reference players using the format `#` instead of their names. Userid clan tag doesn't apply to bots, **ONLY PLAYERS**.

## Dependencies
1. [Metamod:Source (2.X)](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master)
2. [CounterStrikeSharp (=<1.4.2)](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp/releases/) -> Tested on 1.4.2 btw

## Incompatibility
Any plugin that changes Clantag could cause problems with this one.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have CounterStrikeSharp installed on your Counter-Strike 2 server
2. Download my plugin from https://github.com/criskkky/CS2UserIDTags/releases/latest
3. Place the `CS2UserIDTags` folder in `game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/`

## Todo
- Add screenshots to README.MD
- Add examples to show how to take advantage of this plugin if needed
